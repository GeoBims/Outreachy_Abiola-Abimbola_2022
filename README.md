### WHY I CHOSE THIS PROJECT
Climate change won’t just impact forest, or coral reefs, or even people in far-off countries – it will affect all of us. From more extreme weather to increasing food prices, to recreation and decreased opportunities to appreciate the natural world, people everywhere will feel its effects. Scenes of the recent flooding in Nigerian show us just how much climate can affect our lives. Reducing our carbon footprint is fundamentally necessary to create a world where people and nature thrive, and this is why I chose to work on this project.

### What is Climate Change?

Climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns. These shifts may be natural, but since the 1800s, human activities have been the main driver of climate change, primarily due to the burning of fossil fuels (like coal, oil and gas), which produces heat-trapping  gases. (Definition from United nations.  https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/what-is-climate-change). Climate change is the change in the average weather patterns in a region over a long period of time. One component of climate change is global warming, the long-term heating of Earth due to greenhouse emissions. Burning fossil fuels generates greenhouse gas emissions that act like a blanket wrapped around the Earth, trapping the sun’s heat and raising temperatures. Examples of greenhouse gas emissions that are causing climate change include carbon dioxide and methane. These come from using gasoline for driving a car or coal for heating a building, for example. Clearing land and forests can also release carbon dioxide. Landfills for garbage are a major source of methane emissions. Energy, industry, transport, buildings, agriculture and land use are among the main emitters.

### What are the impacts and actions of climate change globally?

Globally, Climate change is already impacting health in a myriad of ways, including by leading to death and illness from increasingly frequent extreme weather events, such as heatwaves, storms and floods, the disruption of food systems, increases in zoonoses and food-, water- and vector-borne diseases, and mental health issues. Climate change’s effects range from sea level rise and more frequent extreme weather events to the loss of biodiversity and increased risk of diseases. Climate change has impacted every form of life—humans, plants, and animals.
