### WHY I CHOSE THIS PROJECT
Climate change won’t just impact forest, or coral reefs, or even people in far-off countries – it will affect all of us. From more extreme weather to increasing food prices, to recreation and decreased opportunities to appreciate the natural world, people everywhere will feel its effects. Scenes of the recent flooding in Nigerian show us just how much climate can affect our lives. Reducing our carbon footprint is fundamentally necessary to create a world where people and nature thrive, and this is why I chose to work on this project.

### What is Climate Change?

Climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns. These shifts may be natural, but since the 1800s, human activities have been the main driver of climate change, primarily due to the burning of fossil fuels (like coal, oil and gas), which produces heat-trapping  gases. (Definition from United nations.  https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/what-is-climate-change). Climate change is the change in the average weather patterns in a region over a long period of time. One component of climate change is global warming, the long-term heating of Earth due to greenhouse emissions. Burning fossil fuels generates greenhouse gas emissions that act like a blanket wrapped around the Earth, trapping the sun’s heat and raising temperatures. Examples of greenhouse gas emissions that are causing climate change include carbon dioxide and methane. These come from using gasoline for driving a car or coal for heating a building, for example. Clearing land and forests can also release carbon dioxide. Landfills for garbage are a major source of methane emissions. Energy, industry, transport, buildings, agriculture and land use are among the main emitters.

### What are the impacts and actions of climate change globally?

Globally, Climate change is already impacting health in a myriad of ways, including by leading to death and illness from increasingly frequent extreme weather events, such as heatwaves, storms and floods, the disruption of food systems, increases in zoonoses and food-, water- and vector-borne diseases, and mental health issues. Climate change’s effects range from sea level rise and more frequent extreme weather events to the loss of biodiversity and increased risk of diseases. Climate change has impacted every form of life—humans, plants, and animals.

### How has climate change affected my local community (Nigeria)

Floods are a recurring natural hazard in Nigeria and have become more frequent throughout the country in the last couple of years and months. Agriculture, health, infrastructure, the economy, and trade have all been negatively impacted, as evidenced recently. Sea levels have been rising along the coast of Nigeria, causing coastal erosion and some villages to be lost (e.g. Areas in Bayelsa, Benue, Kogi and Delta State). Droughts negatively impact the socio-economic growth of Nigeria and are projected to become more severe in the future as a result of climate change. Significant drought years and persistent droughts have the possibility of causing crop failures, loss of livestock, and famines. Additionally, desertification has been occurring in Nigeria, with desert conditions moving southward.

### What can be done to mitigate and adapt to climate change? 

#### ● Speak up! Advocate for changes to our energy system.

#### ● Use renewable energy

#### ● Conserve energy
In a fossil-fuel based society, using energy leads to greenhouse gas emissions. And even low-carbon, clean energy sources cause some environmental degradation. It’s critical that we find ways to use less energy.

#### ● Help conserve and restore forests
Forests excel at taking in and storing carbon. They also provide habitat for our non-human relatives, clean our water and air, prevent flooding and soil erosion, and much more. Advocate for stopping deforestation. Get involved in forest restoration projects.
